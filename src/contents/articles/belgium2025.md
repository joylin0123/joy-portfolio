#### Arrival | Day 1 — Brussels

After my Dutch class on Thursday, I started my trip to Belgium from Amsterdam. PS and SY had already gone to see the EU Parliament and the famous peeing kid statue (of course), while I was still stuck in class.  

I met them later near **[Chocolatier in Bruxelles](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7taCLUWMXNDgCtFTA)** — a cozy little shop with friendly staff who translated every chocolate name into English for us. The chocolates were nice, but I prefer the Kinder we bought in Carrefour (I'm so childish).

#### Gent | Day 2

Gent instantly became my favorite city in Belgium.

The morning began with a friendly cat named **Boots**, who lived just 10 minutes walk from the train station.

Before exploring the city, we stopped by **[Mayana](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EGiKnNCGcmyNJeVm8)** for hot chocolate. At first sip, it was perfect, but halfway through it started to feel like melted chocolate sauce.  Still, the marshmallow slowly dissolving into the drink made it worth trying.

Later, we wandered through Gent’s streets — tall cathedrals, stone bridges, and canals that reflected the sky like glass. It’s the kind of city that makes you walk slowly without realizing it. When we finally reached the main plaza, we just stood there for a while, quiet, took tons of pictures.

For lunch, we had mussels — the ones on top were too dry, but the flavor underneath was fine. The beer was surprisingly good: not bitter, not too strong, but still, I think I’ll always prefer bubble tea :)

The day ended less gracefully than it began.
On the train back to Brussels, PS suddenly threw up, and we ended up waiting at the platform for almost two hours.  
SY and I bought pancakes from Albert to pass the time, and they turned out to be the best ones we had in Belgium — though honestly, **小木屋鬆餅** in Taiwan still wins, with both sweet and savory flavors that reminds me of my time in uni.

#### Brugge & Gent Again | Day 3

Brugge looked like a village from the Middle Ages — cobblestones, horse carriages, and gray skies. Unfortunately, the weather was bad, the city was packed with tourists, and the city center smelled awful because there were horses everywhere, so it didn’t charm me as much as I expected. Maybe I’d come back someday for the Christmas market or in summer to visit the beach nearby.

By the afternoon, we decided to go *back* to Gent.

We went to [Goya Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rPyUmmPEZLSHkUEN8) - lotus cookie with a cup of cappuccino is perfect! Afterwards, we had McDonald's for snacks, just for enjoying the view of Gent with food :)

We had dinner at a small Thai–Vietnamese restaurant called [La Table Impériale](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RHzNgkiVVBuMMYzXA) beside our hostel. The owner's grandfather was a Chinese immigrant, so he spoke Mandarin with us. It instantly felt like home — maybe because of the fish tank next to our table, or the fried onions in the soup that reminded me of Taiwan.

#### Brussels | Day 4

Before heading home, we visited [YAO](https://maps.app.goo.gl/a4RMFsKj6fd7kCnD6), a Taiwanese café in Brussels.
It felt peaceful — beautiful ceramics, friendly owner, and a perfect cappuccino. Next time, I’ll try their oolong tea.

Then it was time to go back to Amsterdam.
Four days went by faster than I thought.

#### Summary

I didn’t know what to expect before going to Belgium. All my friends told me not to go there because their experience were not good. I felt unsafe before going to the country in person. However, after visiting, I think Belgium is underrated. Brugge was pretty but quiet, Brussels felt like a blur, and Gent completely amazed me — easily a must-see city.
