Naples is loud, alive, and chaotic. It took a while to tune in—it’s very different from Amsterdam’s calm canals and bike lanes. On my first night I heard neighbors arguing through thin walls, which was overwhelming. I also saw many unhoused people in the city center, which made me uneasy at first. As I explored, the city’s personality won me over.

On the second night I visited **Kiana**, an architecture student at the University of Naples Federico II. She served saffron tea and told stories about her Persian heritage. We talked about life in Naples and studying architecture. That day I also met **Toyosi**, a Nigerian student from VU who moved to the Netherlands when she was four. She’s into politics and social issues, and our conversation made me want to learn more perspectives.

A few days later, **Paula**—a local student I met at the hackathon—invited me to a café. We chatted for hours before my high school classmate **Pei-Shyuan** arrived in Naples. That night the three of us went to **[Libreria Berisio](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yfVfqmTUVX7tA3qU6)** for drinks: Aperol Spritz and a Bronx cocktail. The bar had a cozy, vintage vibe with nice waitstaff. I felt so comfortable and happy to spend the night with the chicas!

Afterward we ate at **[Bellini Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/U9dERRFDT1bc3m4G8)**. Neapolitan pizza is its own thing: soft, chewy crust; bright tomato; creamy mozzarella; fresh basil. The staffs were really energetic and the price felt soooo affordable after living a while in Amsterdam. Perfecto!

Once **Pei-Shyuan** joined, we had breakfast at [It's | caffè & bistrot](https://www.google.com.tw/maps/place/It's+%7C+caff%C3%A8+%26+bistrot/@40.8493994,14.2510852,21z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x133b0929dd10541d:0x974fe4009c3e6c22!8m2!3d40.8445779!4d14.2513141!16s%2Fg%2F11srhlrfd5?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTAyNy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) every day: cappuccino that wasn’t too bitter or too milky, a flaky pain au chocolat, and a vanilla croissant that wasn’t overly sweet. Everything is balanced together and I’d recommend it.

The **SEIZMIC hackathon** ended with each team presenting. I delivered our closing notes, literally shaking from the beginning until my last word. I hope that we could win the seizmic award so that we could travel together next year!

We celebrated at **[Caffè dell'Epoca](https://maps.app.goo.gl/S7RbmDpXvxxwrNQd7)**. I had another Aperol Spritz and talked with more students; it tasted stronger than yesterday so I asked Pei-Shyuan to finish everything. **Chiara**, a local student from Naples, then took us for gelato and to a bar. Simple, fun night.

Before flying back we climbed to **[Castel Sant’Elmo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VbLgyUR2om7MAcfp6)**. The view—bay plus Vesuvius—made the hike worth it.

Later we visited **Paula** at her dorm. She told us about Catalonia—**turrón**, human towers, and a second Valentine’s Day on March 14. It's super fun to know different cultures. We ate hot pizza and made plans to meet again somewhere new.

Naples is loud, and full of surprises. I’d like to return.
