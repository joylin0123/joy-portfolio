#### TL;DR

We solve a 150-period inventory problem where deliveries arrive only 50% of the time and demand increases seasonally. Using **backward dynamic programming**, we compute the optimal ordering policy and validate it through Monte Carlo simulation. The solution achieves an expected reward of ~33.6 units.

---

#### 1. Introduction

Imagine you manage inventory for a seasonal product—maybe winter coats or holiday decorations. Your supplier is unreliable: when you place an order, there's only a 50/50 chance it arrives in time for that day's sales. Meanwhile, customer demand starts slow but builds steadily as the season progresses.

**The challenge:** Should you order every period? Only when inventory is low? How does the increasing demand probability change your strategy?

This is a classic **finite-horizon stochastic optimization problem**, and it's exactly the type of scenario where dynamic programming (DP) shines. Unlike greedy approaches that optimize each decision in isolation, DP accounts for how today's choice affects all future opportunities.

##### What You'll Learn

By the end of this article, you'll understand:

- How to formulate inventory control as a Bellman equation
- Why unreliable delivery makes this problem non-trivial
- How to implement backward recursion efficiently in Python
- How to validate DP solutions through simulation

**Prerequisites:** Basic Python (NumPy), probability (expectations), and familiarity with recursion. No prior DP experience required.

#### 2. Problem Setup

##### 2.1 Scenario Overview

We model a **seasonal inventory control problem** over **T = 150 time periods**.

**Initial conditions:**

- Store begins with **5 items** in stock
- Each period, the manager decides: order one item, or don't order

**The uncertainty:**

- **Unreliable delivery**: Ordered items arrive with only **50% probability** before that period's sales opportunity
- **Increasing demand**: Customer demand probability grows linearly from near-zero to certain as the season progresses

**Why this is hard:** You can't just "order when low" because:

1. Orders might not arrive when you need them
2. Early in the season, demand is unlikely—holding inventory costs money
3. Late in the season, demand is almost certain—but if you're out of stock, you've missed your best sales opportunities

##### 2.2 Model Parameters Reference

| Symbol | Meaning | Value / Range |
|:-------|:--------|:--------------|
| $T$ | Number of periods | 150 |
| $i_t$ | Inventory at start of period $t$ | $0, 1, \dots, I_{\max}$ |
| $a_t$ | Order decision | $0$ (don't order) or $1$ (order) |
| $D_t$ | Demand in period $t$ | $\text{Bernoulli}(p_t = t/T)$ |
| $R_t$ | Delivery success | $\text{Bernoulli}(0.5)$ |
| Sale profit | Revenue per item sold | $+1.0$ |
| Holding cost | Cost per item per period | $-0.1$ |
| Initial inventory | $i_1$ | $5$ |
| Max inventory | $I_{\max}$ | $60$ (computational cap) |

##### 2.3 Random Demand

Customer demand each period is binary: either someone wants to buy (1) or not (0).

$$
D_t \in \{0, 1\}, \quad P(D_t = 1) = p_t = \frac{t}{T}
$$

**Intuition:** On day 1, demand probability is 1/150 ≈ 0.67%. By day 150, it's 150/150 = 100%. This models a product gaining popularity throughout its season (think holiday shopping momentum).

##### 2.4 Costs and Rewards

Each period, you earn or pay:
- **+1.0** for each item sold (if you have inventory and there's demand)
- **-0.1** for each item left in inventory at period's end (storage, obsolescence)

**Important:** 
- No penalty for unfulfilled demand (lost sales are just $0$ profit)
- No salvage value after period 150
- No backorders (can't sell what you don't have)

Period reward formula:
$$
r_t = (\text{sales profit}) \times (\text{items sold}) - (\text{holding cost}) \times (\text{ending inventory})
$$

##### 2.5 Timeline of Events Each Period

Understanding the sequence is crucial for the state transition:

```md
Period t begins with inventory i_t
    ↓
[1] DECISION: Choose action a_t ∈ {0,1}
    ↓
[2] DELIVERY: If a_t=1, item arrives with prob 0.5 (outcome R_t)
    ↓ 
    Inventory before sales: i_t + a_t·R_t
    ↓
[3] DEMAND: Customer arrives with prob p_t = t/T (outcome D_t)
    ↓
[4] SALE: Sell min(D_t, available inventory)
    ↓
[5] REWARD: Collect profit - holding cost
    ↓
Period t+1 begins with remaining inventory
```

This sequence explains why delivery uncertainty matters: if the item doesn't arrive, you can't sell it that period even if demand occurs.

##### 2.6 Objective

Find a policy $\pi$ (a decision rule) that maximizes expected total reward:

$$
\max_\pi \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{t=1}^{T} r_t(i_t, a_t, R_t, D_t)\right]
$$

Where the policy $\pi_t(i)$ tells us which action to take given we're in period $t$ with inventory $i$.

---

#### 3. Dynamic Programming Formulation

Dynamic programming works by breaking the problem into stages and solving backward from the end. The key insight: **if we know the value of being in any state tomorrow, we can compute the optimal action today**.

##### 3.1 State Variable

At each time $t$, the **state** is simply the inventory level:

$$
i_t \in \{0, 1, 2, \dots, I_{\max}\}
$$

This state is **Markovian**: it contains all information needed to make optimal decisions going forward. We don't need to track the history of past demands or deliveries.

**Why cap at $I_{\max} = 60$?** With holding costs of 0.1 per item per period, building huge inventories is never optimal. Capping at 60 makes computation feasible while covering all practically relevant states.

##### 3.2 Action Variable

Each period's decision:

$$
a_t \in \{0, 1\}
$$

- $a_t = 0$: Don't order
- $a_t = 1$: Order one item

**Note:** We could extend this to ordering multiple items, but the single-item version already captures the essential trade-offs.

##### 3.3 Random Outcomes

After choosing action $a_t$, two independent random events occur:

**Delivery outcome** (only relevant if $a_t = 1$):
$$
R_t \in \{0,1\}, \quad P(R_t = 1) = 0.5
$$

**Customer demand:**
$$
D_t \in \{0,1\}, \quad P(D_t = 1) = p_t = \frac{t}{T}
$$

These create **four scenarios** to consider when computing expectations:

| Delivery | Demand | Probability | What Happens |
|:---------|:-------|:------------|:-------------|
| Arrives ($R_t=1$) | Occurs ($D_t=1$) | $0.5 \times p_t$ | Possibly sell from $i_t+1$ |
| Arrives | None ($D_t=0$) | $0.5 \times (1-p_t)$ | Hold $i_t+1$ items |
| Fails ($R_t=0$) | Occurs | $0.5 \times p_t$ | Possibly sell from $i_t$ |
| Fails | None | $0.5 \times (1-p_t)$ | Hold $i_t$ items |

##### 3.4 State Transition

Inventory evolves according to deliveries and sales:

$$
i_{t+1} = i_t + a_t R_t - \min(D_t, i_t + a_t R_t)
$$

**In words:**

1. Start with $i_t$
2. Add delivered items (if any): $+ a_t R_t$
3. Subtract items sold: $-\min(D_t, \text{available})$

The $\min$ ensures we can't sell more than we have. Inventory never goes negative.

##### 3.5 Immediate Reward Function

The reward earned in period $t$ is:

$$
r_t(i_t, a_t, R_t, D_t) = \underbrace{1.0 \times \min(D_t, i_t + a_t R_t)}_{\text{sales revenue}} - \underbrace{0.1 \times i_{t+1}}_{\text{holding cost}}
$$

**Example:** If you start with $i_t=2$, order ($a_t=1$), the item arrives ($R_t=1$), and there's demand ($D_t=1$):

- Available inventory before sale: $2 + 1 = 3$
- Sale: $\min(1, 3) = 1$ item
- Ending inventory: $i_{t+1} = 3 - 1 = 2$
- Reward: $1.0 \times 1 - 0.1 \times 2 = 0.8$

##### 3.6 The Bellman Equation

Let $V_t(i)$ be the **maximum expected reward** from period $t$ onward, starting with inventory $i$.

The fundamental recursion:

$$
V_t(i) = \max_{a \in \{0,1\}} \mathbb{E}_{R_t, D_t}\left[r_t(i, a, R_t, D_t) + V_{t+1}(i_{t+1})\right]
$$

**Boundary condition:**
$$
V_{T+1}(i) = 0 \quad \text{for all } i
$$

There's no value after the final period (no salvage value assumption).

**Intuition:** The value of being in state $(t,i)$ equals the best you can do by:

1. Choosing an action $a$
2. Earning the immediate reward
3. Transitioning to next period's state
4. Collecting all future rewards from there onward

##### 3.7 Optimal Policy

The optimal action at each state:

$$
\pi_t^*(i) = \arg\max_{a \in \{0,1\}} \mathbb{E}_{R_t, D_t}\left[r_t(i, a, R_t, D_t) + V_{t+1}(i_{t+1})\right]
$$

This policy $\pi^*$ is a lookup table: given period $t$ and inventory $i$, it tells us whether to order.

##### 3.8 Computing Expectations Explicitly

To compute the expectation for a given action $a$, we enumerate all four scenarios:

$$
\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}[\cdot] &= P(R_t=1, D_t=1) \times [\text{reward + value if both occur}] \\
&+ P(R_t=1, D_t=0) \times [\text{reward + value if delivery but no demand}] \\
&+ P(R_t=0, D_t=1) \times [\text{reward + value if demand but no delivery}] \\
&+ P(R_t=0, D_t=0) \times [\text{reward + value if neither}]
\end{align}
$$

Since $R_t$ and $D_t$ are independent:
$$
P(R_t=r, D_t=d) = P(R_t=r) \times P(D_t=d)
$$

##### 3.9 Backward Induction Algorithm

We solve the Bellman equation by working **backward in time**:

```python
For t = T, T-1, T-2, ..., 1:
    For each inventory level i = 0, 1, ..., I_max:
        Compute expected value for a=0 (don't order)
        Compute expected value for a=1 (order)
        V_t(i) = max of the two
        π_t(i) = action that achieved the max
```

**Why backward?** When computing $V_t(i)$, we need to know $V_{t+1}(\cdot)$ for all possible next states. Working backward ensures this information is always available.

---

#### 4. Implementation Walkthrough

Now we translate the mathematical formulation into executable Python code. The implementation follows the DP structure closely, with careful attention to vectorization for efficiency.

##### 4.1 Configuration and Setup

```python
import numpy as np

# Model parameters
T = 150              # number of time periods
HOLD_COST = 0.1      # holding cost per item per period
SALE_PROFIT = 1.0    # profit per sold item
INIT_INV = 5         # initial inventory
ARRIVAL_PROB = 0.5   # probability that an order arrives
ORDER_SET = (0, 1)   # possible actions: don't order (0) or order (1)
I_MAX = 60           # inventory cap for computational efficiency
N_SIM = 1000         # number of simulation runs for validation
SEED = 42
```

**Design choice:** `I_MAX = 60` is a truncation level. States beyond this are theoretically possible but practically never optimal to reach due to holding costs.

##### 4.2 Data Structures

We use NumPy arrays to store the DP tables:

```python
# Value function: V[t, i] = max expected reward from period t with inventory i
V = np.zeros((T + 2, I_MAX + 1))

# Policy: PI[t, i] = optimal action (0 or 1) at period t with inventory i
PI = np.zeros((T + 1, I_MAX + 1), dtype=int)
```

**Array dimensions:**

- Time dimension: `T+2` to accommodate periods 1 through T, plus the terminal period T+1
- Inventory dimension: `I_MAX+1` to include inventory levels 0 through I_MAX

##### 4.3 Computing Expected Values

This is the core of the DP algorithm. For a given action $a$, we compute the expected value across all possible outcomes.

**Key insight:** We can vectorize across all inventory levels simultaneously, computing expectations for all states in period $t$ at once.

```python
def expected_for_action(a: int, p_demand: float, V_next: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Compute expected value for action a across all inventory levels.
    
    Args:
        a: action (0 or 1)
        p_demand: probability of demand in this period
        V_next: value function for next period, shape (I_MAX+1,)
    
    Returns:
        Array of expected values, shape (I_MAX+1,)
    """
    # Vector of all possible inventory levels
    i_vec = np.arange(I_MAX + 1)
    
    # Inventory after potential delivery, capped at I_MAX
    i_plus = np.minimum(i_vec + a, I_MAX)
    
    # ===== SCENARIO 1 & 2: Order arrives (if a=1) =====
    # If demand occurs: sell 1 if available
    sales_arrived = np.minimum(i_plus, 1)
    inv_after_sale_arrived = i_plus - sales_arrived
    
    # Reward if demand: +profit for sale, -holding cost for remaining inventory
    reward_demand_arrived = (SALE_PROFIT * sales_arrived - 
                            HOLD_COST * inv_after_sale_arrived)
    
    # Reward if no demand: just pay holding cost
    reward_no_demand_arrived = -HOLD_COST * i_plus
    
    # Expected value if delivery arrives
    EV_arrived = (p_demand * (reward_demand_arrived + V_next[inv_after_sale_arrived]) +
                  (1 - p_demand) * (reward_no_demand_arrived + V_next[i_plus]))
    
    # ===== SCENARIO 3 & 4: Order doesn't arrive (or a=0) =====
    sales_notarrived = np.minimum(i_vec, 1)
    inv_after_sale_notarrived = i_vec - sales_notarrived
    
    reward_demand_notarrived = (SALE_PROFIT * sales_notarrived - 
                                HOLD_COST * inv_after_sale_notarrived)
    reward_no_demand_notarrived = -HOLD_COST * i_vec
    
    # Expected value if delivery fails
    EV_notarrived = (p_demand * (reward_demand_notarrived + V_next[inv_after_sale_notarrived]) +
                     (1 - p_demand) * (reward_no_demand_notarrived + V_next[i_vec]))
    
    # ===== COMBINE: Weight by delivery probability =====
    # If a=0, ARRIVAL_PROB*EV_arrived is irrelevant (i_plus = i_vec)
    return ARRIVAL_PROB * EV_arrived + (1 - ARRIVAL_PROB) * EV_notarrived
```

**Why this works:**

- NumPy's element-wise operations compute the expectation for all 61 inventory levels in parallel
- `np.minimum(i_plus, 1)` captures "sell at most 1 item if demand occurs"
- Indexing `V_next[inv_after_sale_arrived]` looks up the value of transitioning to each possible next state

##### 4.4 The Backward Recursion Loop

```python
def solve_dp():
    """Solve the inventory problem via backward dynamic programming."""
    
    # Initialize terminal condition: V[T+1, :] = 0 (already done by np.zeros)
    
    # Work backward from period T to period 1
    for t in range(T, 0, -1):
        # Demand probability increases linearly with time
        p_demand = t / T
        
        # Value function for next period
        V_next = V[t + 1]
        
        # Compute expected values for both actions across all inventory levels
        EV_a0 = expected_for_action(0, p_demand, V_next)  # don't order
        EV_a1 = expected_for_action(1, p_demand, V_next)  # order
        
        # Choose action that maximizes expected value
        better_a1 = EV_a1 > EV_a0
        V[t] = np.where(better_a1, EV_a1, EV_a0)
        PI[t] = np.where(better_a1, 1, 0)
    
    return V, PI

# Run the DP algorithm
V, PI = solve_dp()

print(f"Optimal expected reward V_1(5): {V[1, INIT_INV]:.4f}")
```

**Execution flow:**

1. Start at $t=T$ (period 150)
2. For each inventory level, compute which action is better
3. Store the optimal value and action
4. Move to $t=T-1$ and repeat
5. Continue until $t=1$

**Result:** `V[1, 5]` gives us the expected reward starting from period 1 with initial inventory 5, following the optimal policy.

##### 4.5 Monte Carlo Simulation for Validation

Dynamic programming gives us the *theoretical* optimal value. Simulation verifies that the policy actually achieves this value when executed:

```python
def simulate_policy(PI, n_runs=N_SIM, seed=SEED):
    """
    Simulate the inventory system following the computed policy.
    
    Returns:
        Array of total rewards from each simulation run
    """
    rng = np.random.default_rng(seed)
    rewards = np.zeros(n_runs)
    
    for k in range(n_runs):
        inv = INIT_INV
        total_reward = 0.0
        
        for t in range(1, T + 1):
            # Look up optimal action from policy table
            # (clamp inventory to valid range in case of edge cases)
            a = int(PI[t, min(inv, I_MAX)])
            
            # Random delivery outcome (only matters if a=1)
            delivery_arrives = rng.random() < ARRIVAL_PROB
            inv_after_delivery = inv + (a * int(delivery_arrives))
            inv_after_delivery = min(inv_after_delivery, I_MAX)  # respect cap
            
            # Random demand outcome
            demand_occurs = rng.random() < (t / T)
            sales = min(inv_after_delivery, int(demand_occurs))
            
            # Update inventory
            inv = inv_after_delivery - sales
            
            # Compute reward for this period
            reward = SALE_PROFIT * sales - HOLD_COST * inv
            total_reward += reward
        
        rewards[k] = total_reward
    
    return rewards

# Run simulation
sim_rewards = simulate_policy(PI)
print(f"Simulation average: {sim_rewards.mean():.4f} (std={sim_rewards.std():.4f})")
print(f"95% CI: [{np.percentile(sim_rewards, 2.5):.2f}, {np.percentile(sim_rewards, 97.5):.2f}]")
```

**Expected output:**

```python
Optimal expected reward V_1(5): 33.6151
Simulation average: 33.5497 (std=6.3287)
95% CI: [21.30, 45.80]
```

**Interpretation:**

- The simulation average (~33.55) closely matches the DP prediction (~33.62)
- Small difference is due to finite sampling (would converge with more runs)
- This validates that our DP implementation is correct

---

#### 5. Understanding the Optimal Policy

Now that we've computed $\pi^*(t, i)$, what does it actually tell us to do?

##### 5.1 Policy Structure

The optimal policy can be visualized as a heatmap where white = "don't order" and black = "order":

```md
Inventory →
0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 ...
Period ↓
  1:  [1  1  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 ...]
  10: [1  1  1  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 ...]
  50: [1  1  1  1  1  0  0  0  0  0  0 ...]
 100: [1  1  1  1  1  1  0  0  0  0  0 ...]
 150: [1  1  1  1  1  1  1  0  0  0  0 ...]
```

**Key insights:**

1. **Threshold structure:** For each period, there's a critical inventory level above which we don't order
2. **Thresholds increase over time:** Early in the season, we maintain lower inventory (demand is unlikely). Later, we're willing to hold more (demand is nearly certain)
3. **Never order at high inventory:** The holding cost makes large stockpiles uneconomical

##### 5.2 Intuitive Explanation

**Early periods (low demand probability):**

- Demand is unlikely, so holding inventory is expensive relative to potential sales
- Only order if inventory is very low (≤2-3 items)
- Risk of paying holding costs outweighs missing rare sales

**Middle periods (moderate demand):**

- Demand becomes more likely, making sales opportunities more valuable
- Willing to maintain higher inventory (≤4-5 items)
- Balance between holding costs and sales potential shifts

**Late periods (high demand probability):**

- Demand is almost certain
- Aggressively maintain inventory (≤6-7 items)
- Missing a sale now is very costly, holding costs matter less

##### 5.3 The Role of Delivery Uncertainty

Why can't we just use a simple "order when inventory drops below X" rule?

**The delivery uncertainty creates a hedging problem:**

- If you wait until inventory = 0 to order, you might not receive the item in time
- If you order too early, you pay holding costs while waiting for demand
- The 50% delivery rate means you need to "pre-order" to some extent

This is why the optimal policy has a threshold structure that adapts to the demand probability: it balances the risk of stockouts against the cost of holding inventory, accounting for the delivery uncertainty.

---

#### 6. Key Takeaways

##### Technical Insights

1. **DP handles uncertainty elegantly:** By computing expectations over all random outcomes, we find the globally optimal policy
2. **Backward induction is essential:** We need future values to optimize current decisions
3. **Vectorization matters:** NumPy's array operations make the computation tractable (milliseconds instead of seconds)

##### Practical Extensions

This framework can be extended to handle:

- **Multiple items per order:** Change action space to $a \in \{0, 1, 2, \ldots\}$
- **Variable delivery times:** Model $R_t$ with delays instead of binary success
- **Price optimization:** Make selling price a decision variable
- **Multiple products:** Use multi-dimensional state space
- **Lost sales penalty:** Add negative reward for unfulfilled demand
